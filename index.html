				<h1>Research Associate</h1>
				<h2><i>Cognitive Artificial Intelligence Research Group</i></h2>
				<p>I conducted a research under the supervision of Air First Marshall Dr. Ir. Arwin Sumari on aircraft recognition 
					systems using machine learning and speech recognition where mostly I lead the project running.

				<h1>Head of Group</h1>
				<h2><i>Indosat Ooredo Hutchison FAST (Future Academy Skill Transformation) Batch-1</i></h2>
				<p>As Team Lead, I managed a team of 10 to build an application prototype for trash-to-points exchange. 
					The concept was to allow users to scan trash they collect through their smartphone application and receive points 
					in exchange. Points accumulated could then be redeemed for discounts or promotions from partner merchants.

				<h1>Bachelor of Applied Computer</h1>
				<h2><i>State Polytechnic of Malang</i></h2>
				<p>I have maintained a well balanced score while taking challenging courses such as Data Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, 
					Project Management, and E-Business. Beyond my coursework, I was able to obtain intellectual property rights or patent for an 
					innovative application that I developed. My application utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques 
					like Na√Øve Bayes classification combined with voice input capabilities. It has promising applications for defense 
					by enabling remote visual recognition of unmanned combat aircraft.

			<h1>Selected Projects</h1>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/abdullohndm/UAV_Identifier">UAVIdentifier</a> is built using Python (TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn to train the model) and Flask. Using machine learning, this app is primarily focus on predicting what is the closest UAV that being inputted by voice.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/abdullohndm/Projek_3_Web_Coffee">Kopiku</a> basically a website using Codeigniter 3 for coffee management systems to help coffee owner's manage their daily use using this website. What's unique of this app is their UX because it's simplicity that made user easier to manage. </li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/abdullohndm/kasku">Kasku</a> is a fintech project that allow user to manage their personal financial report such as tracking income and expense in their android phone.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/abdullohndm/SimpleSTT">SimplEStT</a>, to make it work just press play and then stop to see how speech to text in Indonesian words works.</li>
			<li>When you think you think someone is so patient wait until you see them waiting for parking line -especially in Indonesia-, that's why me and my team integrating website and smartphone to make it as less time consuming as possible in <a href="https://github.com/AlifiaZaidaNurmaya/proyek/tree/master">ParkirAssistant</a>, you can use phone to book your parking before you even get there, so that you going to the place that supported the application seamlessly.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/abdullohndm/PCVK_Genap_20-21">Computer Vision Basic</a>, there is plenty of mini project where I learn about basic Image Detection and using Python.</li>
